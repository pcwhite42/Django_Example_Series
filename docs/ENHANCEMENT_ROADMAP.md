# FILE PURPOSE: Snapshot of completed and outstanding enhancements for the tutorial.
# NEXT: Update this file when new enhancements are delivered or reprioritized.

## Completed Enhancements
- Added pinned dependency list (`requirements.txt`).
- Created `docs/COMMAND_CHEATSHEET.md` for command references.
- Wrote onboarding portal linking all guides.
- Documented migrations workflow (`docs/MIGRATIONS_CHECKLIST.md`) and troubleshooting (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- Added smoke tests (`dashboard/tests.py`) and reset helper (`scripts/reset_db.py`).
- Authored collaboration resources (`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`), feedback template, and visual capture guide.
- Embedded debugging tips directly in `dashboard/views.py`.

## Remaining Ideas (from ENHANCEMENTS.md)
- Produce real screenshots/GIFs for `/`, `/about/`, `/admin/`, and CLI setup (requires manual capture).
- Draft `docs/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md` extensions for retrospectives with templates. *(In progress / next iteration)*.
- Automate screenshot compression and thumbnail generation (future script).

## Next Suggested Steps
1. Capture baseline screenshots following `docs/VISUAL_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md` and embed them in README/WALKTHROUGH.
2. Extend `docs/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md` with retrospective template and pairing rotation schedule.
3. Consider a short video walkthrough (hosted outside repo, linked from README).
