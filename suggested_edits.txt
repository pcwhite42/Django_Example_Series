MUST FIX
- [ ] Missing committed migration for ExampleRecord (File: dashboard/models.py:8; File: dashboard/admin.py:13). Why: A clean clone plus the documented `python manage.py makemigrations` workflow leaves no `dashboard_examplerecord` table, so visiting `/admin/dashboard/examplerecord/` throws `django.db.utils.OperationalError`. Suggestion:
  ```bash
  # From the project root, generate and ship the initial migration
  python manage.py makemigrations dashboard
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  Acceptance Criteria: `dashboard/migrations/__init__.py` and `dashboard/migrations/0001_initial.py` are version-controlled, `python manage.py migrate` succeeds on a fresh database without manual edits, and `/admin/dashboard/examplerecord/` loads without a 500 error.

SHOULD IMPROVE
- [ ] Tighten setup docs around migrations (File: README.md:69-75; File: ADMIN_ONBOARDING.md:5-13). Why: The current text tells learners to run `python manage.py makemigrations`, but with shipped migrations they will see "No changes detected" and may assume something failed. Suggestion: Add a short note that the repo already includes the initial migration (once committed) and that `makemigrations` is only required after they edit models, or explicitly instruct them to run `python manage.py makemigrations dashboard` if they want to regenerate it. Acceptance Criteria: Updated docs set correct expectations so newcomers know whether "No changes detected" is acceptable or when to expect a generated migration file.
- [ ] Remove or ignore the committed SQLite database (File: db.sqlite3). Why: Shipping a pre-built database that is out of sync with the models hides migration bugs and can mask why the admin throws errors during setup. Suggestion: Drop `db.sqlite3` from version control and add it to `.gitignore`, or document a step that deletes/regenerates the database before running migrations. Acceptance Criteria: Fresh clones create their own SQLite file during `python manage.py migrate`, and no stale database is tracked in the repo.

NICE TO HAVE
- [ ] Add a smoke-test module for core pages (File: dashboard/tests.py (new)). Why: A lightweight `Client` test gives beginners a repeatable way to verify `/`, `/about/`, and `/admin/` behavior after edits. Suggestion:
  ```python
  # dashboard/tests.py
  from django.test import TestCase
  from django.urls import reverse

  class PageSmokeTests(TestCase):
      def test_public_pages(self):
          for path in (reverse("dashboard:home"), reverse("dashboard:about")):
              self.assertEqual(self.client.get(path).status_code, 200)

      def test_admin_redirects(self):
          response = self.client.get(reverse("admin:index"))
          self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
  ```
  Acceptance Criteria: Running `python manage.py test dashboard` passes and fails if any of the key routes regress.
- [ ] Clarify or remove the empty scaffold file (File: Example.py:1). Why: An unexplained empty file can distract learners who are following breadcrumbs. Suggestion: Either delete it or replace it with a short comment explaining its relevance (if any). Acceptance Criteria: The repo no longer contains unexplained empty files, or they include a breadcrumb that ties into the tutorial.

Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Initial migration committed and admin `/admin/dashboard/examplerecord/` loads without errors.
- [ ] Documentation tells learners exactly what to expect from `makemigrations` and how to reset the database.
- [ ] Optional smoke tests added (or deferred) with a conscious decision.
- [ ] Repository tree contains no unexplained placeholder files.
