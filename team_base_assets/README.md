# FILE PURPOSE: Drop-in folder for your group's shared CSS, base templates, and prebuilt dashboards/charts.
# HOW TO USE: Paste your assets here (e.g., CSS files, base templates, CSV display snippets, bargraph components).
# NEXT STEPS (ONCE FILES ARE ADDED):
# 1) Tell Codex (or your teammate) that the assets are in place.
# 2) We will document how to include them in this tutorial and in new Django projects (template inheritance, static files, and sample views).
# 3) We will add beginner-friendly how-to guides showing where to reference these files in settings, templates, and views.
